# ETL-Pipeline-MySQL-to-Impala-HDFS
This project provides an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that moves data from a MySQL database to an HDFS cluster for querying through Impala. It automates the process of extracting data from MySQL, performing optional transformations, and loading the data efficiently into HDFS in a format optimized for analytics.
